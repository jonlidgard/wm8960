This library is a quick port of the

[*SparkFun WM8960 Arduino Library*](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_WM8960_Arduino_Library) to ESP-IDF.

See the example dir for an idea of how to use it.

Ver 0.0.1 - Not all functions tested at present so expect a few bugs, (although I have code working that uses this component).
